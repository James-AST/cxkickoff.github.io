# Lab 2: Custom Code Analysis

## Prerequisites
We will be using our __totallysecureapp__ project, which is available at https://github.com/cxworkshops/totallysecureapp. If you have not already done so, clone the project to your local machine, as defined in [Lab 1](../lab1_setup/).

## Introduction
SAST, or Static Application Security Testing, enables developers and security teams to scan application source code to find, index, and enumerate weaknesses that lead to vulnerabilities within the application.  Checkmarx supports [over 30 languages and frameworks](https://checkmarx.com/resource/documents/en/34965-46283-supported-code-languages-and-frameworks-for-9-5-0.html)
