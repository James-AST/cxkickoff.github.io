# Lab 2: Infrastructure-as-Code Analysis

## Prerequisites
We will be using our __totallysecureapp__ project, which is available at https://github.com/cxworkshops/totallysecureapp. If you have not already done so, clone the project to your local machine, as defined in [Lab 1](../lab1_setup/).

## Introduction
In addition to application source code static analysis, Checkmarx also offers Infrastructure-as-code analysis. We include our IaC scan engine in our Checkmarx One platform, but Checkmarx KICS is also available as an open source solution. Checkmarx IaC supports all mainstream IaC platformsâ€”Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible, Helm, and more.
