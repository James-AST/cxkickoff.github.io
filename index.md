Welcome to the R&D Kickoff lab for learning about and getting hands-on with Checkmarx products and solutions. 

There are four type of labs (you can choose multiple ones time permitting):

1. The IDE lab provided within this GitHub Page
2. [API Lab](https://checkmarx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CPT/pages/6761447556/API+Results+Lab)
3. [Checkmarx One Overview](https://checkmarx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CPT/pages/6794707317/CxOne+Advanced+Lab)
4. [Fusion & API Security](https://checkmarx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CPT/pages/6763021439/Fusion+and+API-Security+Lab)

{: .note }
A temporary API key to provision access to a Checkmarx One tenant can be found [here](https://checkmarx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CPT/pages/6793986487/API+Key).  If you wish to try these labs on your own, you will need your own tenant and/or API key.  To create an API key, see [Generating an API Key](https://checkmarx.com/resource/documents/en/34965-118315-authentication-for-checkmarx-one-cli.html#UUID-a4e31a96-1f36-6293-e95a-97b4b9189060_UUID-1e7abdfa-77eb-2a6c-f12a-c812a1e1dcf7)

If you don't have access to your own Checkmarx One tenant, please message James Brotsos on MS Teams and I will create one for you during the lab time.
